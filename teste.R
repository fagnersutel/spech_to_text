### IBM Watson - TEXT TO SPEECH WITH EXPRESSIVE - Code Snippet 
### Experimental Code. R Interface for IBM Watson Services 
### http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html
### Before you begin you will need (1) An IBM Bluemix demo account (2) TTS Services stood up (3) Credentials to each Service
